        <p class="story__p">!!It was a Tuesday, late May of 2018, when Panagiotis Avrithis, a lawyer and active member
          of
          the
          community in the
          island
          of Kos, had a surprise visit from a client of his who lives in the neighboring island of Leros. No appointment
          had
          been
          scheduled between the two and there was no open legal case of his pending. The reason for his visit, as he
          said,
          was “to
          say goodbye”. No further explanation was given.
        </p>
        <p class="story__p">
          About a week later, Mr. Avrithis and his wife would realize what their elderly client had in mind – and the
          rest
          of
          Greece with them. The day before, the man’s son and his daughter-in-law had been arrested, after having
          confessed
          to a
          series of acts of sexual abuse towards their children. And almost instantly, next to being a family friend,
          Mr.
          Avrithis
          put on his lawyer hat and became the prosecutor for the trial.
        </p>
        <p class="story__p">
          The incident became the number one issue on Greece’s sensationalist noontime TV shows. Mr. Avrithis would
          answer
          to “one
          in twenty journalists” who called him, “whoever was the lucky one”. The phone lines of the Police, the State
          Prosecutor,
          the City Hall of Leros, the Hospital, the Community Centre and anyone who could provide any information were
          on
          fire.
          The headlines spoke of a “Horror without an end in Leros”, “Revelations for the Parents-Monsters”, “Shocking
          Details on
          the Parents-Monsters of Leros”. Online news outlets were continuously updated with “new revelations”, “twists”
          and
          opinions by anyone willing to comment on the incident.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Avrithis has also used the word “monster” in one of his interviews. But the term wasn’t his choice. He was
          simply
          quoting the elderly gentleman, the grandfather of the abused children, who used the word referring to his son
          in
          a
          phone
          call with the lawyer, after the events had come to light. The file is still in the Interrogator’s bureau when
          we
          sit
          down for an interview with him, but the testimonies in it are accusing the parents of repeated sexual and
          physical
          abuse, as well as forcing the children to work on the family’s plot in harsh circumstances.

        </p>
        <p>
          The family had four children. The oldest one, a boy, left the house as soon as he reached adulthood. According
          to
          statements, he had also suffered continuous physical abuse. He has three younger siblings: two brothers -22
          and
          9
          years
          old- and a 14-year-old children. In the parents’ confessions, it was the elder ones who had suffered the
          abuse.
          The
          youngest one had not gone through the abuse - “yet”, adds Mr. Avrithis.

        </p>

        <h2 class="story__section" id="section02">An Absent Safety Net</h2>
        <p>Popi Emmanouil is a social worker in the State Infirmary of Leros. She constitutes the island’s Social
          Service
          by
          herself, meaning she is the only person who can receive an order by the State Prosecutor, conduct a social
          investigation
          into the issue and file a report. She’s often called upon to do the same for the neighboring islands. This is
          a
          difficult feat, and not only in terms of the workload. In a distant island like Leros, even something as
          simple
          as
          getting the funds to transfer children to the “Agia Sofia” hospital in Athens to be examined, is not always
          feasible.
        </p>
        <p id="redd" class="green">Ms. Emmanouil has dealt with such a case in the past, in which she received a
          negative response on
          the funds
          needed for
          transferring children to Athens from the City of Leros (since its responsibility only concerns cases that are
          dealt by
          its non-existent Social Service), the State Infirmary (since only the City of Leros is allowed to have
          expenses
          for
          transferring children) and the company that owns the ship lines (which refused the transfer of the children
          for
          free). A
          solution was provided by the Church of Leros which provided the travel expenses, out of sheer goodwill.
        </p>
        <p>Ms. Emmanouil has an acute sense of duty. She explains at length the difficulty of placing limits between her
          work and
          her personal life and the ways in which she protects her own children – emotionally or otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>A few days earlier, Ms. Anta Kafasari, the Prefect for Minors in the State Prosecutor bureau of Kos, has used
          an
          example
          of a personal experience of hers with Ms. Emmanouil to highlight the emotional dangers of their work: once,
          the
          two of
          them escorted four children to the “Agia Sofia” hospital in Athens and ended up spending a few days with them.
          The
          children had been removed from parents with severe mental health issues. On the last day, the youngest one,
          still
          an
          infant, spoke for the first time and called Ms. Emmanouil “mama”; and on the next day, Ms. Emmanouil would
          return
          to
          Leros, the children were moved to a shelter and they would never see each other again.
        </p>
        <p>The claims that lead us to Ms. Emmanouil, show that her involvement in the abuse incident has been crucial,
          but
          she
          cannot discuss it. A veil of silence has been spread over all involved authorities. The State Infirmary does
          not
          answer
          our repeated requests for an interview with Ms. Emmanouil – we can only talk to her for a general view of her
          profession. Our attempts to get permission for an interview with the policeman who handled the interrogation
          and
          brought
          out the confessions were not fruitful. Also, according to the headmistress of the local Junior High School,
          the
          Federation of School Teachers has banned any discussion with journalists on the issue.
        </p>
        <h2 class="story__section" id="section03">The Plight of the Children
        </h2>
        <p>Both in Athens and in Leros, there are many people involved willing to talk anonymously. A variety of sources
          have
          confirmed that in the summer of 2017, by order of the State Prosecutor, the daughter, then 12 years old, was
          escorted by
          her parents to Athens to be examined in “Agia Sofia” hospital. The youngest boy, 6 years old at the time, was
          also
          taken
          to “Agia Sofia” for a “preventive examination”. From there, the boy returned home to Leros with the parents.
          The
          daughter was removed from custody and became one of the many children who are hospitalized without reason for
          extended
          periods of time. After two months, judicial authorities placed her in the custody of an institution ran by the
          church.
          The question of how can two people be adequate parents for one child and inadequate for another was neither
          asked,
          nor
          answered.
        </p>
        <p>A few months later, in the fall of 2017, the girl inexplicably reappeared in Leros. The only mandatory
          commitment
          was
          that she would attend weekly sessions with a psychologist, not at the hospital, but at the Community Centre
          ran
          by
          the
          City of Leros. The State Prosecutor of Kos did not order any social investigation into the family.
        </p>
        <p>One day in May 2018, the parents arrived at the Community Centre. Their daughter was in the back seat of the
          car
          half-faint. Ms. Vaso Evangelou, the Centre’s social worker, perceived this as an expression of anxiety over
          school,
          similar to ones she had in the past. After she came around with the help of Ms. Evangelou, she returned home.
          On
          the
          next day, a Friday, she came back to the centre underfed, refusing to eat or drink, her faint all the more
          intense. This
          time, she was immediately taken to the State Infirmary of Leros.
        </p>
        <p>At the same time as the child was at the Infirmary, the children’s aunt testified on her own volition at the
          Police
          Precinct of Leros. Later, in September she would unsuccessfully file for custody of the children. After her
          aunt’s
          testimony, the girl also opened up and testified herself. And then, the parents’ confession sealed the case.
          The
          parents
          were arrested, while the children were moved by order of the State Prosecutor to a hotel in Kos and then to a
          shelter
          where they live until today.
        </p>
        <p>All residents of Leros who comment on the issue agree that the children are “saved”. Their future seems
          better,
          but
          that’s not necessarily true for other children who might be going through a similar plight in the island. The
          City
          still
          lacks a Social Service, let alone one that would specialize in dealing with incidents of child abuse. The
          island
          still
          lacks a child psychologist or child psychiatrist. Schools still lack specialized personnel that could assist
          in
          tracing
          such incidents in time.
        </p>
        <p>Even the family house, which is vacant nowadays, has not changed at all. It is still the hermetically sealed
          citadel on
          top of a mountain village – almost identical to the other houses nearby. There are no squares or cafes. Two
          elderly
          ladies sitting in the balcony on top of the village’s only shop – a hairdresser’s salon – are the sum total of
          its
          street life. Despite the good weather, all other residents of the village are locked in their houses. Cars and
          trailers
          are parked outside, but no window blind is open. Suddenly, the claim that if anything bad was happening,
          Leros’
          society
          could not know about it, seems a little bit more convincing. They might also not know in the future.
