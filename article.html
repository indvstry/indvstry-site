      <h1>Running any NPM package in the browser locally</h1>

      <p>
        JavaScript has never had any official solution for distributing
        packages, and every web platform (Rails, Django etc) has their own idea
        of how to structure and package JavaScript. In the last few years NPM
        has started becoming the canonical way of distribution, with Webpack as
        the build system, but thereâ€™s no way to load NPM packages in the browser
        without a server-side component.
